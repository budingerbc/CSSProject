      <p class="aboutMe">My name is Ben and this is my my first professionaly developed website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
        I have taken several college courses for programming, specifically for Python, Java, and some C.
        Currently I work as a Help Desk Technician at Moss Adams LLP, one of the largest accounting firms in the Pacific Northwest.
        I have been working in this field for nearly seven years and would like to begin anew in programming.
